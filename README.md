### I will create restaurant admin dashboard using Vue Js 3

### I will create a login and registration for each user. Only the accessed users will be able to log into the restaurant system.

### Users will be able to add and manage multiple locations, categories and menu items.

### Each user will have his/her own profile page which he/she can manage at any time.

### We will use these technologies [VUE JS 3, Bootstrap 5, Axios, JSON Server, Vue Router, Vuelidate, Rest API] in our application.
